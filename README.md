a) Use chatgpt to write an medium.com article on best practices for writing prompts.

apply this best practices in your custom domain for a full example. 

another part of the project: You will write an app which will critique a given prompt for all the missing information. Put gpt4 as expert prompt engineer and ask it to critique and provide clues on how to improve and suggest changes for improvements so user can accept

chatgpt conversation for applying best practices in my custom domain for a full example:

 b) Write an gradio or streamlit application for perfect prompt generation with proper ux  (following all best practices) using gpt4 assisted help

You will brainstorm with prompt gpt for meta prompting. come up with best prompt

Your web app -  will ask very detailed inquiry of the user requirements in iterative back and forth fashion until you have all the information you need

customer  will be able to test end2end the prompt with samples 

Then you will have refinement and iteration.

c) Write a full web app for prompt library with prompt search (use pinecone langchain library) - people can contribute the prompts nad search for prompts
